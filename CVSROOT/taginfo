# The "taginfo" file is used to control pre-tag checks.
# The filter on the right is invoked with the following arguments:
#
# $1 -- tagname
# $2 -- operation "add" for tag, "mov" for tag -F, and "del" for tag -d
# $3 -- repository
# $4->  file revision [file revision ...]
#
# A non-zero exit of the filter program will cause the tag to be aborted.
#
# The first entry on a line is a regular expression which is tested
# against the directory that the change is being committed to, relative
# to the $CVSROOT.  For the first match that is found, then the remainder
# of the line is the name of the filter to run.
#
# If the repository name does not match any of the regular expressions in this
# file, the "DEFAULT" line is used, if it is specified.
#
# If the name "ALL" appears as a regular expression it is always used
# in addition to the first matching regex or "DEFAULT".

#     C.5 Taginfo 
#
#     The `taginfo' file defines programs to execute when someone executes a
#     tag or rtag command. The `taginfo' file has the standard form for administrative
#     files (see section Reference manual for Administrative files), where each line
#     is a regular expression followed by a command to execute. 
#     
#     In addition to the common format strings (see section The common syntax), `taginfo' supports: 
#     
#     b  -  tag type (T for branch, N for not-branch, or ? for unknown, as during delete operations) 
#     
#     o  -  operation (add for tag, mov for tag -F, or del for tag -d) 
#     
#     t  -  tag name 
#     
#     {sVv}   - file attributes, where: 
#     
#     s  -  file name 
#     
#     V  -  old version number (for a move or delete operation) 
#     
#     v  -  new version number (for an add or move operation) 
#     
#     For example, some valid format strings are `%%', `%p', `%t', `%s', `%{s}', and `%{sVv}'. 
#     
#     Currently, if no format strings are specified, a default string of ` %t %o %p %{sv}' 
#     will be appended to the command line template before replacement is performed, but this
#     feature is deprecated. It is simply in place so that legacy repositories will remain
#     compatible with the new CVS application. For information on updating, see section
#     Updating legacy repositories to stop using deprecated command line template formats. 
#     
#     A non-zero exit of the filter program will cause the tag to be aborted. 
#     
#     Here is an example of using `taginfo' to log tag and rtag commands. In the `taginfo' file put: 
#     
#       ALL /usr/local/cvsroot/CVSROOT/loggit %t %b %o %p %{sVv}
#        
#     
#        Where `/usr/local/cvsroot/CVSROOT/loggit' contains the following script: 
#     
#          #!/bin/sh
#     	 echo "$@" >>/home/kingdon/cvsroot/CVSROOT/taglog
#     	  
#
