	In 1990 President George H Bush signed into law the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americans_with_Disabilities_Act_of_1990">American's with Disabilities Act (ADA)</a>. The purpose of this law was to establish a clear and comprehensive prohibition of discrimination on the basis of disability.  

	<p>
	The ADA has had a far reaching impact on the software industry.  In fact, it has mandated that any piece of software must be usable by any person regardless of their dissability, both physical and cognative.
