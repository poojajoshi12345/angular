	<h1 data-title="ibx Accessibility">ibx and Accessibility (508 Compliance)</h1>
		In 1990, President George H. Bush signed into law the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americans_with_Disabilities_Act_of_1990">Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</a>. The purpose of this law was to establish a clear and comprehensive prohibition of discrimination on the basis of disability.  

	<p>
		The ADA has had a far-reaching impact upon the software industry.  In fact, the law mandated that any piece of software must be <b>fully</b> usable by any person, regardless of their disability, whether physical or cognitive.  Further more, this must be accomplished without any distinction in the user interface.  Developers cannot force a user into a separate "accessible" mode, or create a version of an application with an accessible-specific feature (sub)set.
	</p>
	<p>
		There is a tendency for developers to think of accessible users as just being profoundly blind. However, this is only a small portion of the user base, as accessibility includes any deficit a user might have in the visual/touch/auditory realm. 
	</p>
	<p>
		You might think supporting all levels of users is an unreasonable burden to place on a developer. And, that it couldn't even be accomplished in the real world.  The fact is it can be.  It's not even that difficult once you start thinking about it at a fundamental development level.
	</p>
	<p>
		The ibx architecture has support for accessibility built into its core, at the ibxWidget level.  Additionally, the built in ibx widget library has been made fully <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">WCAG</a> compliant, and can be used out of the box to assemble RIA accessible applications.
	</p>

		<h4>Documents vs. Applications</h4>
		Accessible web content falls into two broad categories:
		<ul>
			<li>Documents
				<br>
					Where the HTML content is used to represent something like a magazine article.  In this case the markup has semantic meaning.  For example an &lt;h1> tag is literally rendered in what a user would expect to be a heading. And assistive technologies, such as screen readers will understand the semantic meaning of the document structure and announce it accordingly.
				</br>
			</li>
			<p></p>
			<li>Applications
				<br>
					Where the HTML doesn't have to have any semantic meaning, and it's used to create the illusion of a "fat client" UI/UX. In this case the assistive technology must be explicitly made aware of what is on the screen, what role it is representing (button/dialog/slider/etc.), and how it fits into the structure of the UI/UX.
				</br>
			</li>
		</ul> 
		<p>
			Applications built using ibx fall squarely into the latter category. The ibx framework uses no document-centric tags or css.  Everthing is explicitly defined according to what it represents from a UI/UX perspective.
		</p>
		<p>
			Because accessibility is built into the framework, most of the work is handled at that level.  The goal is for the develop to simply create the UI/UX in a well thought-out thorough fashion, and a large part of the accessibility will be handled automatically.

		</p>
	</section>

		<h4>Accessible Rich Internet Applications</h4>
		As stated in the above section, ibx applications are explicitly not documents.  They contain no semantic meaning in their markup.  Because of this, their constituent parts must make Readers aware of them.
		<p>
			This is accomplished via <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/">Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA)</a>.  Browsers allow Readers to access the markup so they can examine it to determine what is <i>logically</i> being rendered on the screen.
		</p>
		<p>
			For example, from a Reader's perspective, this markup:
			<pre>
&lt;button tabindex="0">Press Me!&lt;/button>
			</pre>
			Is <b>exactly</b> the same as this markup:
			<pre>
&lt;div tabindex="0" role="button">Press Me!&lt;/div>
			</pre>
			The browser does not pay attention to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/aria-1.1/roles"><i>role</i></a> attribute.  It is there entirely for the Reader's benefit.  So, the second piece of markup will not render as a button, or allow a user to interact with it as such.  The ibx library takes care of all of that, so developers don't have to worry about it.
		</p>

		<h4>ibxWidgets and ARIA</h4>																							+			
		The base widget for all of the ibx library is ibxWidget.  This has a function called <i>setAccessibility(accessible, aria)</i>.  This function is called at key points in the lifecycle of the widget.  Usually when its state changes.  The first parameter "accessible" is a boolean, and it tells the widget to either add or remove the properties specified in the second parameter, "aria".
		<p>
		The "aria parameter is a simple object which can contain any valid ARIA attribute name, such as - label/lebeleldby/owns/expanded/etc.  Whatever is in this object will be prefixed with "aria-" and added as attributes to the widget's element.
