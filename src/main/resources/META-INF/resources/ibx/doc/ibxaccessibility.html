		In 1990, President George H. Bush signed into law the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americans_with_Disabilities_Act_of_1990">Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</a>. The purpose of this law was to establish a clear and comprehensive prohibition of discrimination on the basis of disability.  

	<p>
		The ADA has had a far-reaching impact upon the software industry.  In fact, the law mandated that any piece of software must be <b>fully</b> usable by any person, regardless of their disability, whether physical or cognitive.  Further more, this must be accomplished without any distinction in the user interface.  Developers cannot force a user into a separate "accessible" mode, or create a version of an application with an accessible-specific feature (sub)set.
	</p>
	<p>
		There is a tendency for developers to think of accessible users as just being profoundly blind. However, this is only a small portion of the user base, as accessibility includes any deficit a user might have in the visual/touch/auditory realm. 
	</p>
	<p>
		You might think supporting all levels of users is an unreasonable burden to place on a developer. And, that it couldn't even be accomplished in the real world.  The fact is it can be.  It's not even that difficult once you start thinking about it at a fundamental development level.
	</p>
	<p>
		The ibx architecture has support for accessibility built into its core, at the ibxWidget level.  Additionally, the built in ibx widget library has been made fully <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">WCAG</a> compliant, and can be used out of the box to assemble RIA accessible applications.

		<h4>Documents vs. Applications</h4>
		Accessible web content falls into two broad categories:
		<ul>
			<li>Documents
				<p>
					The HTML content is used to represent something akin to a magazine article.  In this case the markup has semantic meaning.  For example an &lt;h1> tag is literally rendered in what a user would expect to be a heading. And assistive technologies, such as screen readers will understand the semantec meaning of the document structure and announce it accordingly.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>Applications</li>
				<p>
					The HTML content has no semantic meaning, and is used to create the illusion of a "fat client" UI/UX. In this case the assistive technology must be explicitly made aware of what is on the screen, what role it is representing (button/dialog/slider/etc.), and how it fits into the structure of the UI/UX.
				</p>
		</ul> 
		<p>
			The applications you build using ibx fall squarely into the latter category. The ibx framework uses no document-centric tags or css.  Everthing is explicitly defined according to what it represents from a UI/UX perspective.
		</p>
		<p>
			Because accessibility is built into the framework, most of the work is handled at that level.  In most cases you will simply have to defined readable labels and the overarching navigation of your UI.

		You might think this is an unreasonable burden to place on developers, and can't be accomplished in the real world.  The fact is it can be, and it's not even that difficult once you start thinking about it at a fundamental development level. You just have to take a moment to consider it like you would any other UI/UX issue.  In most cases it works like...

	<p>
		<i>"Where should I put this button, and what label should it have?"</i>...and...<i><b>how will the user get to it via the keyboard...how should it announce itself?</b></i>
	</p>

		The fact is, well designed UI/UX will generally support accessibility out of the box.  This is because the

		<h4>Documents vs. Applications</h4>
		Accessible web content falls into the two broad categories of documents, and applications.  Documents being wikipedia articles, pdf files, or what you are reading now, and applications being things like Google Docs, or WEbFOCUS. The two types of content deal with accessibility in very different ways.
