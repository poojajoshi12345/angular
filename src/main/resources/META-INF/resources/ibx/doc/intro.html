	<h1>ibx Introduction</h1>
	<section>
		<h4>What is it?</h4>
		ibx is a simple, declarative-style, HTML5/CSS/Javascript library that is designed for rapid application development.
		<p/>
		It offers the following broad set of features:
		<p/>
		1. Resource management - that is, you can centralize and manage all of the assets your application needs from simple XML 'manifest' files.
		<p/>
		2. Normalized UI Library - it has a full set of standard widgets built in for creating complex web apps with rich UI.
		<p/>
		3. Built on jQueryUI Widgets, so it is simple to derive of built in widgets, or create your own from scratch.
		<p/>
		4. Allows for UI to be defined directly in markup.  This makes management of widget definitions simple, maintainable, and reusable.
		<p/>
		5. Is framework agnostic. You can use ibx with any other framework/library.

		<h4>Why is it?</h4>
		ibx was created because Information Builders has, in the past, relied on third party libraries and frameworks.  These have worked well for us, but have drawbacks.
		<p/>
		1. Proprietary solutions required hefty licesning fees for distribution.  They also tied IBI to the fortunes of the supplier.  If they stopped supporting the product
		then we had to.
		<p/>
		2. Open source solutions have all the same problems as listed above, but with the added issues of no reliable support at all.
		<p/>
		The other big problem with the above solutions is that they tend to come and go like the tides.  Today, maybe everyone is talking about Angular, or React, but
		as we know, tomorrow they will be talking about Django/Express/Vue/Meteor/Bootstrap/etc.

		WebFOCUS Development decided to bypass all of this, and just create a proprietary framework that IBI can control entirely.  Which doesn't tie us to any outside vendor/supplier.
		We believed this approach gives us maximal flexibility, and agility vis-a-vis the ever growing web architecture.
		<p/>
		ibx also gives us a rich internal ecosystem in which new developers can leverage a broad base of existing development knowledge.

		<h4>How do I use it?</h4>
		Similar to jQuery you just include a single javascript file 'ibx.js' and it will automatically bootstrap itself.  
		This includes loading jQuery and all assets required to run an ibx appliction.
		<p/>
		Much like jQuery, ibx has a simple function that you can pass a function to which will act as a 'main' function for your application.
