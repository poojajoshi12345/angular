# MV page manager (built in IBX)

## Description
This project is a rebuild of the Angular MV page manager in the IBX framework. 

I've used typescript to develop the scripting for this project because of it's class and typing system, which will ensure that developers in the future will have a clearer understanding of what the shape of necessary javascript objects is. 
the scripts in `src/typescripts` are where development should occur. 
## Setup 
### Installing npm and typescript
()
### running dev configuration

## Notes
To Make this package manageable, we're using the buidl tool Gulp to manage
